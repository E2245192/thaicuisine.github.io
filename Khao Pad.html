        <h3 style="color: #F8FFD2;">Instructions </h3>
       
       <div style="text-align: center;"> <h4>Prepare Ingredients:</h4>
<p>Cook the jasmine rice and let it cool. It's best to use leftover rice as it tends to be less sticky. <br>
Chop garlic, onion, mixed vegetables, and any protein you are using. <br>
Beat the eggs in a small bowl.</p>

 <h4>Stir-Fry Vegetables and Protein:</h4>
 <p>Heat vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. <br>
    Add minced garlic and chopped onion. Stir-fry until aromatic and onions are translucent. <br>
    Add mixed vegetables and cook until they are tender but still crisp. <br>
    Push the vegetables to the side of the wok, and add the beaten eggs to the empty space. Scramble the eggs until just set.</p>

 <h4>Add Rice and Protein:</h4>
 <p>Add the cooked rice to the wok, breaking up any clumps. <br>
    Add the cooked protein (chicken, shrimp, or tofu) to the rice and vegetables. Stir to combine.</p>

 <h4>Season the Dish:</h4>
 <p>Pour soy sauce over the rice and stir to combine. If using fish sauce, add it at this point.
    Sprinkle sugar and white pepper over the mixture. Stir well to ensure even seasoning.</p>

 <h4>Finish and Garnish:</h4>

 <p>Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is heated through and slightly crispy. <br>
    Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. <br>
    Garnish with chopped green onions and fresh cilantro.</p>
